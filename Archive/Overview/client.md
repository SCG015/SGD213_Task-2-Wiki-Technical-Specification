Ian, the artist?

## Intentions
I need a base stealth game made so I can continue to work on creating assets for it. 
Specifically, she said that:
> It doesnâ€™t need to be pretty.
> I need a base working player controller that can walk and crouch.
> Interaction with doors and boxes.
> I also need sentries that patrol back and forth between two points (That can be changed by myself)
> Cameras that are stationary and scan an area.
> I need these scanning abilities to be blocked by the environment so that the player can walk and crouch behind things.
