# Project Overview

## Overview
A base stealth game. It should have a base working player controller that can walk and crouch. It also requires sentries that patrol back and forth between two points (that can be changed by the client). The game will also need Cameras that are stationary and scan an area. Players will also need to interact with doors and boxes. Lastly, all scanning functions need to be blocked by the environment so that the player can walk and crouch behind things.
