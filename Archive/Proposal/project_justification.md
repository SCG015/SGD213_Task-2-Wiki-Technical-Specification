# Justification
[//]: # (This section is an example of justifying your design and development decisions.)

## Overview

### Brief
[//]: # (What was the client's brief?)
The client is seeking a proof of concept for a game that is simple, yet a leader in its class
* Users should be drawn to the game by its eye-catching visuals
* The audio in the game should be exciting and drive the player's emotion
* The gameplay should be fast-paced, quick to gain feedback and quick to retry

### Communication
* When do you need this prototype by?
> I need the prototype by Friday Week 13.

* What kind of games do you think are good?
> Couch coop games appear to be simple enough to develop and can move reasonable units if done well.

* Since you only need a prototype, are you happy for us to focus on gameplay and use based geometry for art assets?
> Yes perfect, the prototype is a proof of concept, please don't waste time on creating art assets; if the game is fun with simple art assets, that is perfect. At least change the colour palette to be aesthetically pleasing though.

* Do you need a menu system?
> Well I need to be able to take this to potential investors to sell the idea. If I need to quit out of it every time I finish that will not work. It will need basic UI functionality, pausing, quitting out of game, exiting the application, returning to main menu, playing the game from main menu.

* Are there any themes you think are popular or you would like to see in your game?
> Hmm... not really. I do like dragons though! I think silly games catch people's eyes?

## Project Understanding

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product in 5 weeks.
* Gameplay should be fast-paced
* Rounds should be short
* Should be quick to restart
* Feedback is a major point
* People should be drawn to it by it's appearance
    * Needs a catchy name

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues encountered
* Quality transparent project management (add the client)
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art
    * Can use basic geometry
    * Should still look nice using colour palettes

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Particles will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free particle assets

## Risks

### Risks
[//]: # (What are the risks of this project)
* Unity and C# are excellent prototyping tools, but working quickly often means less than perfect code
    * Project may not be fit for use in further development
    * Bugs may be present in prototype due to the short turn-around
    * Working quickly is error-prone

### Risk Management
[//]: # (How are you managing the mentioned risks)
* All coding will aim to be designed in an extensible manner
* Testing will be undertaken throughout prototype development
* Using source control we will ensure our code is safe and usable at all times

## Constraints

### Constraints
[//]: # (What are the constraints of this project)
* We have a tight timeframe, so we will need to make fast decisions, which may be less than perfect

## Justification
We really like the mention of "silly games catch people's eyes". So we took your suggestion of dragons and built on it with alliteration as a starting point. We went through many ideas, but finally came up with a title called "Donuts, Daggers & Dragons.

The name along was enough to get conversation happening, and we soon found ourselves thinking of countless, comical and enjoyable scenarios stemming from the title.

etc. Explain your design decisions in regards to the client's requirements.
