# Risks 

## Github Conflict and Merge Issues
Likelihood:2
Consequence:2
Risk Value:4

Mitigation: Preparing our project scenes for use with github to help prevent merge issues on non code files. Planning so that there is as little crossover between between working files. Communication between team members when working on possible conflicting files.

## Feature is harder to implement that thought
Likelihood:2
Consequence:2
Risk Value:4

Mitigation: Revisit scope and scale back if neccessary. Plan better.


## Client Changes their mind about requirements
Likelihood:2
Consequence:2
Risk Value:4

Mitigation: Have a contract with client that clearly outlines expected deliverables, and discusses alterations to original specifications

## Team Member Hit By Bus
Likelihood:1
Consequence:3
Risk Value:3

Mitigation: Have each team member across/and working on each others components

## Project Corruption / Data Loss
Likelihood:1
Consequence:3
Risk Value:3

Mitigation: The use of source control means that we should be able to roll back our repo to recover from. We can also each keep several safety backups. Well documented process in the event that recovery in not possible.


## Unity install not working at home
Likelihood:1
Consequence:2
Risk Value:2

Mitigation: The labs on campus will always have Unity avaialbe on them. Access to another PC with an installation of Unity. A copy of the installer of your Unity version.



## Deadline is moved forward
Likelihood:1
Consequence:2
Risk Value:2

Mitigation: Regular scrum to keep on track. Scaling back on scope and prioritising tasks to complete as much as possible within the new deadline.
