# Constraints 

## Time
Our project will be affected by time constraints imposed primairly by a limitation of available hours. Between such events such as engaging in full time employment, the course workload of full time study and the ever approaching end of semester date.


##Resources
One resource constraint impacting this project is the use of the Unity engine, as both Nat and I have more experiecne in Unreal.
