# Welcome

Welcome to your wiki! This is the default page we've installed for your convenience. Go ahead and edit it.

## SGD213

For SGD213, you will be using this wiki to submit your Assessment 2!
To begin, we've set up a template for you, although you can edit it as much as you like.

Your wiki template begins below.
Make sure that you delete any pages that you don't want to submit - like this welcome page!

We recommend using Visual Studio Code (a separate application to the main Visual Studio we use for Unity) to edit the wiki, as it has a lot of nice features.

## Editing the Wiki

Please read over the GitHub documentation on GitWikis. Alternatively, you can stick with the .md files and edit them here.

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. The [MarkDownDemo tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo) shows how various elements are rendered. Here is a great [cheatsheet for markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
